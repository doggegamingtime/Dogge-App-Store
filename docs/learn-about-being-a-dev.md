# Learn about being a dev

Being a developer is a big responsibility. You have to make sure all the code is right, hope that it gets famous on your software publisher (ex. Google Play) and lots more. But DAS makes it **easy**.

## Make your game

To start off, you need to make a game. You can use sites such as arcade.makecode.org, scratch.mit.edu and more! But MakeCode and Scratch support **blocks**. If you want to publish your game on the DAS, this is where you learn how to do it.

## Publish your game to DAS

To start off, go to the Developer Portal which can be accessed by 1. Going to https://doggegamingtime.github.io/Dogge-App-Store/devs/portal or 2. Going to https://doggegamingtime.github.io/Dogge-App-Store/docs and click the **Developer Portal** hyperlink.

Then, click **Upload my game**. Choose if you used Scratch or MakeCode. After that, you will be presented with a Google Form. Upload your **sb3** file if you chose Scratch, or upload your **PNG** file if you chose MakeCode. In around 24 hours, go to https://doggegamingtime.github.io/Dogge-App-Store/new and see if your game is there/

## Feel good about yourself

Well done! You should feel proud as you just uploaded **your own game** to an app store!
